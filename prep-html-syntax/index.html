<p style="color:black;">The Mandalorian is my favorite Star Wars character because honestly <br>I never watched the original films, and the recent sequals were mediocre <br>in my oppinion. I got Disney+ for The Mandalorian though and really <br>enjoy the story as well as the actors. Was hoping Boba Fett would be cool <br>too but just couldn't get in to it.</p>
